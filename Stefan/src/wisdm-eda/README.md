#Update 10 Jan 2026

> Created by: Stefan
> Implemented logic to do EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the WISDM dataset (raw and transformed versions).
> Split the dataset into 3 sets.

> How to run the script:
    1. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    2. In a Linux environment run the command `./run.sh eda.py`. The output plots, metrics and logs can be found in the workdir/ folder.
